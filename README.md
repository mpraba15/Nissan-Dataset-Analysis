## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Nissan vehicle dataset to gain insights into various aspects of car listings, including model specifications, performance, mileage, and condition. The primary goal appears to be data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature analysis to prepare the dataset for further modeling or insights.

### Key Steps in the Analysis
## Data Understanding:
Loading the dataset
Exploring the structure using .head(), .tail(), .info(), and .describe()
Checking for missing values
Data Preprocessing

## Handling duplicate records:
Filling missing values with appropriate measures (mean, median, mode)
Standardizing column values

## Feature Analysis:
Univariate and bivariate analysis
Investigating the relationship between key features
This project likely aims to clean and analyze Nissan car data for further use in pricing models, market insights, or predictive analytics.
